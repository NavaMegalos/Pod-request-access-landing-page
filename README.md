## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned
In this project I learned how to use a sort combination between flexbox and grid, also I learn how to put my background image in a way that fit all the page itself and positioning my logo and my content in front of it, nevertheless, I have to learn more about best practices but I am on the road to be a better web developer... so, until later!
